# JavaScript Mastery Phase - DevSteps Series

Welcome to the **JavaScript Mastery Phase** of the **DevSteps Series** by GDG IIIT Kota! ðŸš€ This phase is designed to give you a strong foundation in JavaScript, making you confident in using it for real-world web development. Whether you're new to JavaScript or want to solidify your knowledge, this phase will guide you through hands-on sessions, interactive coding, and real-life use cases.

## What You'll Learn
Throughout this phase, weâ€™ll cover essential JavaScript concepts, including:
